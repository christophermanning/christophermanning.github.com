As with many early internet paradigms 'click here' has become the equivalent of the verbal overuse of 'like': an unnecessary filler before getting to the real point.

<h4>Admitting You Have a Problem</h4>
It is worth realizing that yours is not the first web site your user has seen (unless you are the operator of acoolwebsite.com). For the rest of us, telling a user what to do with a hyperlink is on par with having instructions on how to scroll and see the rest of a web page. Is it underlined? Does it react when I hover over it? Does it stand out from the rest of the text? If so, I know it's a link and I have a pretty good clue what is going to happen if I click it. The text of a link should answer a user's questions. "Where do I go to read more of this article" should translate to a 'Read more' link. "How do I get to the next page" gives us a 'Next page' link. "What is this web site's privacy policy" can turn into 'Privacy'.

<h4>Wait, What?</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="{{page.url}}">Click here</a> to go to a web page about the overuse of 'click here'</li>
  <li>Click <a href="{{page.url}}">here</a> to go to a web page about the overuse of 'click here'</li>
  <li><a href="{{page.url}}">Click here to go to a web page about the overuse of 'click here'</a></li>
  <li>Click here to <a href="{{page.url}}">go to a web page about the overuse of 'click here'</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Obviously We Have a Problem</h4>

<tr><td>"click here"</td><td>1,620,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>"click here to"</td><td>831,000,000</td></tr>

<h4>Solace</h4>
<a href="{{page.url}}">The overuse of 'click here'</a>
In conclusion, I believe using a 'click here' qualifier to help the user actually makes it more confusing considering how inconsistent the 'Click here' linking can be. Any argument for keeping it I would have to rebut with the actualization that you would have to put 'click here' in front of every link. Imagining a menu navigation with that much filler should clarify my point.
