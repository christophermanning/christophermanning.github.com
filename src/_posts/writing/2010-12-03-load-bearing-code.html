<p>
The term 'load-bearing code' can be used to refer to software that exhibits the following attributes.

<ul>
<li>Has no documentation or automated tests</li>
<li>Written by an ex-developer</li>
<li>Used by a large portion of the code base</li>
<li>Supports critical system processes</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have encountered load-bearing code in legacy open source applications, inherited projects, or debugging production software.
