  My cousin who lives in Japan was my secret santa this year. When I first received this gift, I had no idea what it was.
  When I eventually found out that it was an <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mugen-Endless-Bubble-Popping-Keychain/dp/B001IEAB60">infinite bubble wrap simulator</a>. Shortly afterwards, I realized it makes a peculiar sound after clicking it fifty times or so. So, as opposed to just manually clicking it to hear the sounds, I determined it would be far more ridiculous to wire the device to an automatic trigger.

  <p>
  The breadboard has a 555 timer that triggers the transistor to let voltage from the positive lead of the clicker to the negative lead. I used a sufficient resistor so the voltage going across the transistor did not exceed the 3v that the clicker output. Turning the pulse interval too high causes the clicker to not trigger.

  After those, the sounds repeat.
